# Chapter 5: Conditionals and recursion

## Overview 

Now we are getting to some *sorta* complex stuff (for my level anw) involving 
recursion.

**Exercice 1** involves taking a number of seconds (taken from the `time` 
module) and converting it into days, hours, minutes and seconds. This was a bit 
boring so I added the extra challenge of computing the exact date after said 
time has elapsed. This was way more of a hassle but it (*kinda*) works. I will 
have to look further into the `time` module to optimize it. This may be more 
readable using classes but I'm not familiar with those yet.

**Exercice 2** involves checking if *Fermatâ€™s Last Theorem* applies to 3 given 
integers. **Exercice 3** involves checking if a triangle if valid, implicitely 
calling for use of the *triangular inequality*.

**Exercice 4** involves analyzing a given recursive function. **Exercice 5** 
involves analyzing a `turtle` algorithm and figuring out what it does. 
**Exercice 6** involves drawing a fractal using a recursive algorithm .The 
algorithm is given, you just have to write an implementation of it.

## Status

- **Exercice 1**: missing 

- **Exercice 1 extra credit**: *sorta* working but not optimized

- **rest**: missing
