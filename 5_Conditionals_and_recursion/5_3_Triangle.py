"""
The pedestrian way would be to check if:
a + b >= c and a + c >= b andÂ b + c >= a
(and that all lengths are positive)
and then conclude that it is a valid triangle.

The clever way is to realize that we only have to check
that the longest side length is less than the semiperimeter.
That is that if c is the longest side length, that we have c <= a + b
I may put a short demonstration in the README at some point but eh
