# Chapter 1: The way of the program

## Overview

These exercices are designed to familiarize yourself with the Python interpreter
and are both rather basic.

**Exercice 1** is messing around with the `print` function and with numbers to 
see what is allowed.

**Exercice 2** is using the Python interpreter as a calculator, mainly using
multiplication and division. We are asked to convert units from min:sec to sec
etc. and to calculate a speed.

I have done them in the interpreter and don't have a trace of it. I intend to 
make a TeX file for the **Exercice 1** so I can display what I type into 
the interpreter as well as the output. 
**Exercice 2** shall be a simple script without any functions.

## Status

- **Exercice 1**: missing

- **Exercice 2**: missing

- **Exercice statement**: copied and pasted but not proper LaTeX document, it's 
just the body and so it will **not** compile.
