# Think-Python-3-solutions

## Introduction

Though I have some background in Python (as well as in Julia and a bit of C), I have decided to properly learn Python from the ground up with the book *Think Python How to Think Like a Computer Scientist* (2nd Edition, Version 2.4.0).

I will be posting here the solutions that I come up with for the exercises.

The book tells us to use "only the statements and other features [...] learned so far." sometimes. So far, I have used features not introduced (such as `for` loops). I will try to post both compliant (*pedestrian*) solutions and the solutions i would write using "advanced" features (such as `for` loops).

If anybody is reading this (which I doubt), feel free to raise issues about my scripts.


## Progression Status

- Chapter 1

- Chapter 2

- Chapter 3

- Chapter 4

- Chapter 5


## Structure

If I have the motivation, each chapter will have its own directory with :

- The exercise statement directly taken from the book, as a TeX file, 

- The solutions, both pedestrian and *fancy*,

- A README, which should contain commentaries and status on my solutions (something like not working/working/optimized/commented)


## Information on the book 

You may find more info on the book right [here](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/),
