# Think-Python-3-solutions

Though I have some background in Python (as well as in Julia and a bit of C), I have decided to properly learn Python from the ground up with the book *Think Python How to Think Like a Computer Scientist* (2nd Edition, Version 2.4.0).

I will be posting here the solutions that I come up with for the exercises.

The book tells us to use "only the statements and other features [...] learned so far." sometimes. So far, I have used features not introduced (such as `for` loops). I will try to post both compliant solutions and the solutions i would write using "advanced" features (such as `for` loops).

If anybody is reading this (which I doubt), feel free to raise issues about my scripts.
