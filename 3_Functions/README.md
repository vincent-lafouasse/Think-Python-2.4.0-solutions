# Chapter 3: Functions

## Overview

Now we are getting to more interesting stuff than just the Python interpreter.
**Exercice 1** involves string manipulation, **Exercice 2** is writing a 
program that repeats a function twice and **Exercice 3** involves *drawing* an
ASCII grid using `+`, `|` and `-`.

**Exercices 1** and **2** are easy so I did them in the interpreter. **Exercice 
3** was annoying to do without `for` loops and also not general enough for my 
taste. The version presented here is a *fancy* version using *fancy* features 
such as `for` loops. I intend to write the pedestrian version at some point.


Note: we are dealing only with `void` functions so far.

## Status

- **Exercice 1**: ready

- **Exercice 2**: ready

- **Exercice 3**: 
    - *fancy* version optimized (I think) but not commented 
    - pedestrian version ready but perhaps needs more explaining

- **Exercice statement**: ready except for Exercise 3
