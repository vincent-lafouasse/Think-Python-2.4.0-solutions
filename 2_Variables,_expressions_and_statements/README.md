# Chapter 2: Variables, expressions and statements

## Overview

Similarly to chapter 1, these exercices are designed to get you to mess around
with the interpreter to get a sense of what is allowed and what is not. 
The main difference here is that you begin to assign values to variables (or 
assign objects to names ?? i think ??).

As with the exercices 1.X, these are to be done in the interpreter so I don't 
have traces of them *yet*.
