# Chapter 4: Case study: interface design
### using the `turtle` module

## Overview

These exercices involve drawing shapes with the `turtle` module. I have to 
admit it was fun and instructing.

**Exercice 1** involves drawing a *stack diagram* for a function. I have to 
admit I don't quite understand those yet so I will come back to it later. It 
may take a while for me to post a solution also because I inted to draw it 
using Tikz, which I have never used. I may ragequit at some point and just 
post a picture of a drawing.

**Exercice 2** involves drawing pretty flowers, using the `arc` function. 
I haven't done it because i) my `arc` function doesn't work and ii) I don't 
understand quite yet the algorithm to draw those flowers. 

**Exercice 3** involves drawing "turtle pies", which I did using an auxilliary 
function that draws isoceles triangles.

**Exercice 4** involves drawing every letter of the alphabet, which I could not 
be bothered to do tbh.

**Exercice 5** involves drawing a spiral, which I didn't even try to do.
